# Internationalization Workflow

A demo application that showcases a simple internationalized Flutter application.

See the `lib/l10n` directory for the source of the message catalogs used for
the English and Spanish `helloWorld` strings.

The `l10n.yaml` file is required to trigger the internationalizations tool upon
hot reload, hot restart, and running the application.

For more configuration options for the internationalizations tool, use:

```shell
flutter gen-l10n --help
```
